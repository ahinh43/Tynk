# Tynk
A Discord bot that provides other bots higher stability with status checking on Discord, and even on/off-site failover with the usage of another 'node bot'. At the moment, the code is currently set to work with 2 nodes, but will eventually be modified to have greater flexibility in the number of nodes that it will work with.

The folder also contains a powershell script that is meant to be run periodically to check if the script is still running on the machine or not. 

System requirements:
Windows based operating system (Server or pc version)

At least Python 3.6 with discord.py wrapper installed.

Note: This code is for reference. Some of the parts may be modified and can be run on other servers, but I do not guarantee anything will work or not.
